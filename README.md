## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

## 🛠️ How to Run

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

· Install dependencies using npm install.

· Ensure you have the required environment variables and put them in a file called ".env" in the frontend folder:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_KEY: Firebase API key.
  - THE_CAT_API_KEY: API key from The Cat API.

(Note: You can obtain these keys from the respective Firebase and The Cat API dashboards.)

· Start the development server with npm run dev.

## 🔄 Update - January 2024

As of January 2024, the backend structure has been deprecated in favor of a more optimized approach. The backend is now implemented using NextJS API Routes (pages/api) instead of Django and Python. This change aims to enhance performance and simplify the overall project structure.
